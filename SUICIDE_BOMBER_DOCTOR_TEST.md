```

## Technical Implementation
- ✅ Doctor protection checked for each target
- ✅ Protected players added to `protectedTargets` array
- ✅ Only unprotected players eliminated
- ✅ Dynamic messaging based on elimination/protection outcomes
- ✅ Proper logging for debugging

## Game Balance Impact
This creates strategic depth where:
1. **Doctors** must consider protecting key players when a Suicide Bomber might be discovered
2. **Suicide Bombers** must consider who might be protected when choosing targets
3. **Town** gets rewarded for good Doctor play even when a Suicide Bomber is activated
4. **Mafia** still gets value from the Suicide Bomber even if some targets are protected

The mechanic maintains game balance while respecting existing role interactions.
